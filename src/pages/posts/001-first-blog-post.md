We prepared this guide that covers the alternatives you have when building a mobile app, with the main pros and cons of each option.

As a decision maker, your job is to find the best way to get things done. When building a mobile app, one of the first things you’ll find is that there is a wide array of technologies available to build your product. Deciding between sci-fi-sounding technologies like React Native, Ionic, or Native can be quite overwhelming when you are getting started with mobile development.

If you happen to choose a technology that doesn’t match your use case or starts to show its limitations, it’ll force you to either build a sub-par product or start over again, neither of which are fun (or cheap) things to do.
